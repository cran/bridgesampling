\usage{
bf(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)

bayes_factor(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)

\method{bayes_factor}{default}(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)

\method{bf}{bridge}(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)

\method{bf}{bridge_list}(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)

\method{bf}{default}(x1, x2, log = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Object of class \code{"bridge"} or \code{"bridge_list"} as returned from \code{\link{bridge_sampler}}. Additionally, the default method assumes that \code{x1} is a single numeric log marginal likelihood (e.g., from \code{\link{logml}}) and will throw an error otherwise.}

\item{x2}{Object of class \code{"bridge"} or \code{"bridge_list"} as returned from \code{\link{bridge_sampler}}. Additionally, the default method assumes that \code{x2} is a single numeric log marginal likelihood (e.g., from \code{\link{logml}}) and will throw an error otherwise.}

\item{log}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, the function returns the log of the Bayes factor. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{currently not used here, but can be used by other methods.}
}
\value{
For the default method returns a list of class \code{"bf_default"} with components:
\itemize{
 \item \code{bf}: (scalar) value of the Bayes factor in favor of the model associated with \code{x1} over the model associated with \code{x2}.
 \item \code{log}: Boolean which indicates whether \code{bf} corresponds to the log Bayes factor.
}


For the method for \code{"bridge"} objects returns a list of class \code{"bf_bridge"} with components:
\itemize{
 \item \code{bf}:  (scalar) value of the Bayes factor in favor of the model associated with \code{x1} over the model associated with \code{x2}.
 \item \code{log}: Boolean which indicates whether \code{bf} corresponds to the log Bayes factor.
}


For the method for \code{"bridge_list"} objects returns a list of class \code{"bf_bridge_list"} with components:
\itemize{
 \item \code{bf}:  a numeric vector consisting of Bayes factors where each element gives the Bayes factor for one set of logmls in favor of the model associated with \code{x1} over the model associated with \code{x2}. The length of this vector is given by the \code{"bridge_list"} element with the most \code{repetitions}. Elements with fewer repetitions will be recycled (with warning).
 \item \code{bf_median_based}: (scalar) value of the Bayes factor in favor of the model associated with \code{x1} over the model associated with \code{x2} that is based on the median values of the logml estimates.
 \item \code{log}: Boolean which indicates whether \code{bf} corresponds to the log Bayes factor.

\description{
Generic function that computes Bayes factor(s) from marginal likelihoods. \code{bayes_factor()} is simply an (S3 generic) alias for \code{bf()}.
}
\details{
Computes the Bayes factor (Kass & Raftery, 1995) in favor of the model associated with \code{x1} over the model associated with \code{x2}.
